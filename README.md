# 🎮 Pokedex – React + Vite + Tailwind

A simple **Pokédex web app** built with **React**, **Vite**, and **TailwindCSS** — created while learning how to use `useEffect` for fetching data from the **PokéAPI**.

This project was one of my early experiments in React development, focusing on **API fetching**, **component rendering**, and **responsive styling**.  
While the code might not be perfect, I took time to make it **visually clean and polished** — it represents my first hands-on milestone in frontend development.
